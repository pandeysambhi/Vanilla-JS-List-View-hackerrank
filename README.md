# Vanilla-JS-List-View-hackerrank
**This project renders List View with vanilla Javascript!**
*Yupp!! It does just that.* 
This is the solution I provided to one of the vanilla JS coding question I faced for an online test on hackerrank..

**Description**
There is an input field and an insert button provided. Write the code to render the item provided in the input field using vanilla javascript only.

**Requirements**

 - Display the value entered from the input box.
 - If the button is clicked for an empty input, render a warning message, which will disappear when correct value is entered.
 - The input field should be cleared after inserting the value in the list.
 - Every 3rd element(3,6,9......so on) in the list should be displayed red.
